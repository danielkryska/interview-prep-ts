# Interview preparation TS

The repository main goal is to implement the most known and used data structures, algorithms and design patterns.

## Data structures

- [x] Linked list
- [ ] Doubly linked list
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Min Heap
- [ ] Max Heap
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Binary tree
- [ ] Graph
- [ ] Tree
- [ ] Hash table
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Circular linked list
- [ ] graph
- [ ] AVL Tree

## Algorithms

- [ ] breadth first traversal
- [ ] deep first traversal
- [ ] is palindrome?
- [ ] are two texts anagrams?
- [ ] find all permutations of string
- [ ] do tree left rotation
- [ ] do tree right rotation
- [ ] calculate a number of all unique paths from some point in MxN matrix
- [ ] solve traveling salesman problem
- [ ] find shortest path in graph based on edges weights (Dijikstra's algorithm)
- [ ] find Longest Common Substring

- [ ] find maximum sum subarray in array
- [ ] find the most optimal solution for packing the most valuable items sum (Knapsack problem)
- [ ] find Shortest Common Supersequence
- [ ] is number power of 2? (bit operation)
- [ ] switch  anumber sign (bit operation)
- [ ] divide number by two (bit operation)
- [ ] multiple by 2 (bit operation)
